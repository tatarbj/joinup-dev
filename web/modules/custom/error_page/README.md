# Description

Shows a friendly page to the users when an exception or an error are thrown,
instead of the plain page provided by Drupal core. The module is able to attach
an Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) to each error/exception, so that the
user is able to refer the error to the site's contact support team or help desk.
The UUID is logged also in the Drupal log.

# Technical aspects

## Drupal services, configuration, theming

Uncaught exceptions indicates that something really wrong has happened on a
site. There is a great chance that some, or all, of Drupal services are not
available. For this reason, in the module we are avoiding to use or refer Drupal
services as much as possible. For the same reason, the module cannot be
configured using the configuration management offered by Drupal. Instead, the
module will use the settings stored in the `settings.php` file to configure its
behavior.

This is true also for theming. The Drupal/Twig rendering engine cannot be used,
as it would involve usage of Drupal services as well. However, the outputted
page or message can still be customized because they are simple static HTML
pages with some raw replacement tokens.

## How it works?

### Uncaught exceptions

The module swaps the core `ExceptionLoggingSubscriber`, which is responsible
for logging the uncaught exceptions to the Drupal logger, with its own
`ErrorPageExceptionLoggingSubscriber`. Actually the module class replaces the
`::onError()` method and logs also the UUID if it has been configured so. Then,
the module adds a new subscriber, `ErrorPageFinalExceptionSubscriber`, which
acts just before the core `FinalExceptionSubscriber` by showing the output in
its own way and stopping the propagation of the `KernelEvents::EXCEPTION` event.

## Fatal and user errors

The module uses its own error/exception handlers, instead of
`_drupal_error_handler()` and `_drupal_exception_handler()`. Because those
procedural functions are hard to be extended or overwritten, the core code is
95% copied in module's handlers. These are slightly changed to allow using a
custom outputted HTML rendered markup.  

# Getting started

## Install

Install the module as any other module. There are no other dependencies.

## Configure

As explained earlier, the entire configuration is done via `settings.php`:

### ErrorPageErrorHandler autoload

As the container might not be available yet when an uncaught exception or a
fatal error occur, the auto-loading might not work for extensions such as
modules. Thus we cannot register our error/exception handlers, which live in
`ErrorPageErrorHandler`. The system must be instructed explicitly from where to
load the class. If you are using composer this is done automatically because in
the module's `composer.json` we've added the class as a `classmap` entry of
`autoload`. If, for some reasons, you're not using Composer, then you'll need to
explicitly require the file. In this case, in `settings.php` just add this line:

```php
// Note that the path to error handler might be different on some installations.
require_once 'modules/custom/error_page/src/ErrorPageErrorHandler.php';
```

### Set the custom error handlers

Next two lines should be added in `settings.php`:

```php
set_error_handler(['Drupal\error_page\ErrorPageErrorHandler', 'handleError']);
set_exception_handler([
  'Drupal\error_page\ErrorPageErrorHandler',
  'handleException',
]);
```

### Configuration

In `settings.php`:

```php
// If to create a UUID for each exception/error. Defaults to TRUE.
$settings['error_page']['uuid'] = TRUE;
// Point to the path where the customizable HTML markup files are placed. It's
// recommended that the custom template location is placed outside the webtree
// or is protected from the public access with a file, such as markup/.htaccess.
// Defaults to the templates provided by module, in the `markup/` sub-directory.
$settings['error_page']['template_dir'] = DRUPAL_ROOT . '/../path/to/templates';
```

### All together

Your `settings.php` section might look like:

```php
// Only if you don't use composer.
require_once 'modules/custom/error_page/src/ErrorPageErrorHandler.php';
set_error_handler(['Drupal\error_page\ErrorPageErrorHandler', 'handleError']);
set_exception_handler([
  'Drupal\error_page\ErrorPageErrorHandler',
  'handleException',
]);
// Log the UUID in the Drupal logs.
$settings['error_page']['uuid'] = TRUE;
// Your templates are located in path/to/templates, one level above the webroot.
$settings['error_page']['template_dir'] = DRUPAL_ROOT . '/../path/to/templates';
```

# Customizing the output page/message

By default the HTML markup page and message, displayed in case of error or
exception, are very simple but they can be can be customized. Probably the word
"themed" would be too much. In order to customize the output, the files
`markup/error_page.html` and `markup/error_message.html` should be copied and
edited in the location specified in `$settings['error_page']['template_dir']`.
Three variables can be used:

- `{{ uuid }}`: The error/exception UUID, if any.
- `{{ base_path }}`: The Drupal base path, as is returned by `base_path()`. This
  helps to build paths to images or other assets.
- `{{ error_report }}`: The standard error and the error/exception backtrace.
  Note that the content of this variable is empty if the system error logging
  verbosity doesn't allow to show verbose error details such as the backtrace.

Don't forget to protect the templates location from public access or, even
better, place them outside the web-tree.
